Additions:
    General:
        * Added feature that saves the lexers and parsers for internal syntax definition and interpretation script
          handling. This allows for the program to be run faster every use after the tables are generated (previously,
          all parse tables were regenerated during each run of the tool).
            * Lexers and parsers for internal systems can be forced rebuilt by running GLASS with the -rb/--rebuild
              argument in the command line.
        * Added new command line arguments for added flexibility and automation.
            * -so / --script-only - Runs GLASS in script only mode (the user will not be prompted for a syntax
              definition nor a source file).
            * -sd / --syntax-definition - Must be followed by a file path. Will use the file at the provided path as
              the syntax definition automatically (the user will not be prompted for a syntax definition file).
            * -sf / --source-file - Must be followed by a file path. Will use the file at the provided path as the
              source file automatically (the user will not be prompted for a source file).
            * -s / --script - Must be followed by a file path. Will use the file at the provided path as the script
              file automatically (the user will not be prompted for a script file).
    Interpretation Script:
        * Added warning log messages for when traverse() or child() is unable to find a production function
          corresponding to the current node's production.
        * Implemented variable scope.
            * Scope narrows/broadens as expected based on block nesting.
        * Added array support.
            * Arrays can be declared as a list of values surrounded by square brackets (ex. [1, 2, 4, 8]).
            * Arrays can be indexed using typical array indexing notation (ex. array = [1, 2, 4, 8], array[3] equals 8).
            * Arrays contain the following fields:
                * length - returns the number of elements in the array.
            * Arrays support the following functions:
                * add(value) - Adds the provided value to the end of the array.
                * add(index, value) - Inserts the provided value at the provided index.
                * remove(index) - Removes and returns the value at the provided index.
                * push(value) - Inserts the provided value at the front of the array.
                * pop() - Removes and returns the first element of the array.
        * Added floating point number support.
        * Added while loops.
        * Added file I/O support via the new File object type.
            * Files can be declared using an object initialization syntax similar to Java
            (i.e. new File("filename.txt")).
            * Files support the following functions:
                * open(mode) - Opens the file in the desired mode, where 'mode' is either "read" or "write".
                * isOpen() - Returns true if the File is currently open, otherwise returns false.
                * getMode() - Returns "closed" if the File is closed, "read" if the File is opened in read mode, and
                  "write" if the File is opened in write mode.
                * write(data) - If File is opened in write mode, writes the String contents of 'data' to the File.
                * read() - If File is opened in read mode, returns the full contains of the File.
                * readLine() - If File is opened in read mode, returns the next unread line of the File.
                * hasNextLine() - Returns true if the file contains an unread line, otherwise returns false.
                * close() - Closes the File. It may then be reopened using the 'open()' function.
        * Added prompt() function for user input via terminal.
            * Can take an optional argument to print a prompt to the user for input.
            * Returns the contents of the String that the user types.
        * Added SyntaxDefinition object type for loading syntax definitions and ingesting source files
            * The object's constructor takes a String containing the file path of a syntax definition file
              (ex. new SyntaxDefinition("some_file.syntax")).
            * SyntaxDefinitions support the following functions:
                * load() - Loads and parses the contents of the syntax definition file passed to the constructor.
                * ingest(filepath) - Once syntax definition is loaded, this function receives the path to a source file
                  written according to the given syntax definition, and returns a ParseTree object containing the
                  parsed contents of the source file.
        * Added ParseTree object type.
            * This object type can not be initialized via a constructor, and can only be obtained via the
              SyntaxDefinition object's ingest() function.
        * Added Script object type.
            * The object's constructor takes a String containing the file path of an interpretation script file
              (ex. new Script("some_script.gscript")).
            * Scripts support the following functions:
                * load() - Loads and parses the contents of the script file passed to the constructor.
                * execute(parseTree) - Once the script is loaded, this function receives a parse tree and returns
                  the value returned by the called script, if any.
                    * If no parse tree is passed, the value of "parseTree" within the called script will be null.
        * Added new "paresTree" keyword.
            * This keyword contains the contents of the parse tree passed to the current script.
                * Any script called directly by a GLASS interface will use that last parsed source's tree as
                  the value of "parseTree".
                * If no parse tree is passed to the script, the value of "parseTree" within the script will be null.
        * Added several functions for type conversion.
            * int(value) - Attempts to convert the passed value to an integer. If successful, returns the converted
              value. If unsuccessful, will always return 0.
            * float(value) - Attempts to convert the passed value to a float. If successful, returns the converted
              value. If unsuccessful, will always return 0.
            * string(value) - Converts the passed value to a String.
            * boolean(value) - Converts the passed value to a boolean.
        * Added function type(value), which returns the name of the type of the passed value.
        * Added support for user defined functions.
            * User functions can be defined with the following syntax: "function [NAME] ([PARAMETERS]) {[STATEMENTS]}".
              Below is an example:
                    > function sayHello(name) {
                    >     print("Hello " + name + "!");
                    > }
              Calling sayHello("Bob") will result in the String "Hello Bob!" being printed to terminal.
            * Overloading is not currently supported for user-defined functions.
            * User functions may be called before they are defined in the order of the script file (i.e. a function
              definition may appear below a line where the function itself is called).

Changes:
    General:
        * Changed default verbosity setting from one (only errors) to two (errors and warnings).
        * Changed argument '-verbosity' to '--verbosity'.
        * Changed argument '-log' to '--log'.
    Interpretation Script:
        * Modified how all expression operations are handled, ensuring expressions are evaluated as expected (This
          was not a bug, as expression handling simply had a temporary system in place, which has been changed).
        * The traverse() function must now receive a ParseTree object, which will be the ParseTree that is traversed.
          (Old scripts may be fixed by simply replacing traverse() with traverse(parseTree)).
        * traverse() and child() may now receive additional arguments beyond their required arguments.
            * If a production function is successfully called from either traverse() or child(), within the function,
              the variable "args" will be set to an array containing each of the arguments passed to the traverse()
              or child() function.
    Internal:
        * Changed how Strings are represented internally to allow for extra functionality (accessible fields and
          functions) and to allow for more object data types (such as the newly added arrays) to be more easily added
          in the future.

Bug Fixes:
    Interpretation Script:
        * Fixed bug where calling traverse() in a script with no production functions corresponding to the root node
          production would cause GLASS to crash.
        * Fixed bug where calling return() within an if-else block would not properly return from function call,
          causing GLASS to crash.
        * Fixed bug with reading in String literals containing escaped characters (in particular \", \n, \t, \r,
          and \\).
        * String literals can no longer span multiple lines.
