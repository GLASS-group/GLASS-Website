            <p>Hello GLASS-tronauts!</p>
            <p>
                First things first, welcome to our first news post on our website. As the project expands, you can
                expect updates on the News page related to upcoming features, changes, releases, and the like, so keep
                an eye out!
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, we are happy to officially announce the first public release of GLASS! The alpha release is
                available on our downloads page. This release has already been out for about two weeks already, but
                there will be a second alpha release, Alpha 0.2.0, that will be available in the near future, so keep
                an eye out for that.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, you may have noticed that there are several visual changes across the website. This is
                due to a large rewriting of the code of the website, which should allow the website to be more easily
                maintainable in the future. This include this fancy new webpage, as well as things such as small
                changes to how the About Us and Documentation pages are displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's all we have for now, but look forward to more updates, as well as the release of Alpha 0.2.0
                within the next few weeks.
            </p>
