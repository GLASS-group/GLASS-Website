            <p>Hello GLASS-tronauts!</p>
            <p>
                This is just a small update from the GLASS team. We have just released Alpha 0.3.0 for download, which
                contains a variety of small changes and fixes, as well as a few ease of use additions to the
                interpretation script and GUI. The full list of changes, as well as the download itself, can
                be found on our <a href="https://www.glass-project.com/download">download page</a>.
            </p>

                This release officially marks the end of the senior design project phase of our project. To everyone
                who has followed us during this journey, we appreciate your support! Hopefully, the GLASS team can
                continue to expand this project in the future. But for now, we will be taking a break. Look forward
                to more updates sometime in the future!
            </p>
